## Background

The idea was born out of my experience of trying to find a better alternative to Google Sheets for calculating the macros of my meal plans. I wanted to be able to do this on desktop as it's more convenient but nothing really felt fast and simple enough.

A huge inspiration for me has been [excalidraw.com](http://excalidraw.com).
